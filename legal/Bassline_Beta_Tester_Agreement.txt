Bassline Pilates Beta Tester Agreement (Beta Version)

1. Introduction
Thank you for participating as a beta tester for Bassline Pilates. This Agreement outlines your responsibilities, our commitments, and important limitations while using the Bassline Pilates beta application ("the Service").

2. Purpose of Beta Testing
The beta version is provided for the purpose of testing, feedback, and identification of bugs, usability issues, and security improvements. Features are experimental and may change.

3. Voluntary Participation
Your participation is voluntary and you may stop using the beta at any time.

4. Health & Safety Disclaimer
Bassline Pilates is an exercise‑support tool intended to supplement—not replace—professional Pilates instruction.
Always consult a medical professional before beginning any new exercise program.
You participate at your own risk.
Stop exercising immediately if you feel pain, dizziness, or discomfort.

5. Data Collected
During beta testing, the Service may collect:
- Account details (email, optional profile info)
- Class selections and workout history
- Muscle‑group usage records
- App interactions and analytics events
- Device metadata (browser type, timestamp)

6. Confidentiality
The beta version, its features, and materials are confidential. You agree not to share screenshots, videos, or details publicly without permission.

7. Security Measures
Bassline Pilates has undergone early-stage security testing (last updated: December 19, 2025):

Infrastructure Security:
- Python 3.11.14 runtime (latest stable version)
- 95% vulnerability reduction (40 → 1 known vulnerabilities)
- Automated dependency scanning (pip-audit, npm audit)
- All critical security packages updated:
  - cryptography 46.0.3 (4 CVEs fixed)
  - aiohttp 3.12.14 (6 CVEs fixed)
  - langchain 0.3.27 (12 CVEs fixed)
  - python-jose 3.5.0 (2 CVEs fixed)
  - urllib3 2.6.0 (4 CVEs fixed)

Code Security Testing:
- Claude Code secure‑coding review
- GitGuardian secret‑leak scanning
- OWASP ZAP local web‑app scanning
- Wireshark packet inspection verifying no PII transmitted in clear text

Data Protection:
- PII tokenization (AES-256 encryption)
- Row-level security policies (Supabase)
- HTTPS/TLS enforcement
- JWT authentication (HS256)

Compliance:
- GDPR Article 15, 17, 32 compliant

Note: While extensive security measures are in place, no system can guarantee complete security. One remaining vulnerability (ecdsa timing attack) has been assessed as low risk as the application uses HMAC-SHA256, not ECDSA.

We do not guarantee uptime, accuracy, safety, or fitness for any purpose.

9. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent allowed by law, Bassline Pilates is not responsible for:

- Decisions made based on beta functionality or outputs

10. Your Feedback
By providing feedback, you grant Bassline Pilates permission to use your comments for product improvement without obligation or compensation.
