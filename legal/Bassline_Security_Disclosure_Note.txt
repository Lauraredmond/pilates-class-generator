Bassline Pilates – Security Disclosure Note

Thank you for testing the Bassline Pilates beta.
We want you to feel confident that your data and your device are safe while using the app.
Below is an explanation of the security steps we’ve taken and what you should know as a tester.

1. What We Tested
Before inviting testers, Bassline Pilates underwent a structured security review aligned to the key 2025 OWASP Top Risk Categories.  
Our testing covered the following areas:

• Automated Scanning (OWASP ZAP)
  – Scanned the public-facing app for common vulnerabilities such as broken access control, injection issues, and misconfigurations.

• Dependency & Supply Chain Security (AuditNOM, GitGuardian)
  – Reviewed npm packages for known vulnerabilities.
  – Detected malicious or outdated dependencies.
  – Ensured no API keys, secrets, or credentials were exposed in the repository.

• Authentication & Authorization
  – Verified session handling, login security, and access restrictions.
  – Ensured users can access only their own data.

• Database Security (Supabase RLS)
  – Confirmed Row Level Security rules properly isolate user data.
  – Reviewed policy logic for correctness and least‑privilege access.

• Input Validation & Injection Protection
  – Checked for unsafe handling of user input that could allow SQL injection, XSS, or logic bypass.

• Cryptography & Secrets Management
  – Confirmed that all traffic uses HTTPS.
  – Verified password hashing and secure credential storage in environment variables.

• Logging & Error Handling
  – Ensured logs do not contain sensitive data.
  – Checked that error messages do not leak internal information.

• Business Logic & Insecure Design
  – Reviewed app flows to identify places where users could bypass intended restrictions or misuse features.

• Frontend Security Hardening
  – Ensured user-generated content is not injected as HTML.
  – Reviewed React components to reduce XSS risks.

In addition, **Wireshark packet analysis** was performed to confirm that no personal data is transmitted in clear text over the network.

2. What These Tests Mean for You
These checks help identify issues early and improve the safety of your testing experience.  
They do not guarantee perfect security, but they demonstrate that Bassline Pilates is being built with strong, modern security practices.

3. What Bassline Pilates Does NOT Do
• We do not sell or rent your data.  
• We do not use third‑party advertising or behavioural tracking.  
• We do not collect sensitive health data such as injuries or medical history.  

4. What You Should Know as a Tester
Because this is a beta:
• Bugs may appear.  
• Features may behave inconsistently.  
• Data may be reset during updates.  
• Security controls will continue to evolve.

Please report anything unusual to: laura.redm@gmail.com or via the feedback link on the application settings page.

5. How Your Data Is Stored
All core data is stored in the EU:
• Supabase (Ireland – eu-west-1)  
• Render Backend (Germany – eu-central-1)  
• Resend Email Infrastructure (EU region, with limited metadata potentially processed in US under standard contractual clauses)

Netlify serves the static frontend globally but does not store user data.

6. Your Responsibilities
• Use a strong, unique password.  
• Do not share screenshots or internal features publicly.  
• Report issues or concerns quickly.
