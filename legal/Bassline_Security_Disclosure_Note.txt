Bassline Pilates – Security Disclosure Note

Thank you for testing the Bassline Pilates beta.
We want you to feel confident that your data and your device are safe while using the app.
Below is an explanation of the security steps we’ve taken and what you should know as a tester.

1. Security Testing & Current Status
Last Security Review: December 19, 2025

Bassline Pilates has undergone early-stage security testing aligned with OWASP Top 10 2025 and GDPR/EU AI Act requirements.

A. Infrastructure Security (Updated December 19, 2025)
• Python 3.11.14 Runtime
  – Latest stable version with all security patches
  – Upgraded from Python 3.9.6 to address version-specific vulnerabilities

• Dependency Vulnerability Reduction: 95% (40 → 1 known vulnerabilities)
  – Frontend: 0 vulnerabilities (npm audit)
  – Backend: 1 low-risk vulnerability (ecdsa timing attack - does not affect application)

• Critical Security Packages Updated:
  – Cryptography 46.0.3 (fixed 4 CVEs including RSA key exchange vulnerability)
  – Web Framework 3.12.14 (fixed 6 CVEs including XSS, request smuggling, DoS attacks)
  – Authentication Library 3.5.0 (fixed 2 CVEs in JWT token handling)
  – Network Library 2.6.0 (fixed 4 CVEs including resource exhaustion, redirect bypass)
  – AI Libraries 0.3.27 (fixed 12 CVEs including SSRF, XXE, pickle deserialization)
  – Form Data Parser 0.0.18 (fixed 2 ReDoS vulnerabilities)

• Automated Security Scanning
  – pip-audit (Python dependency scanning)
  – npm audit (JavaScript dependency scanning)
  – Monthly automated security reviews

B. Code Security Testing
• Claude Code Secure-Coding Review
  – Static analysis of all code
  – Security best practices verification
  – Regular code quality audits

• GitGuardian Secret Scanning
  – Prevents API keys, tokens, passwords in code repository
  – Continuous monitoring for accidental secret exposure
  – No secrets detected in git history

• OWASP ZAP Automated Scanning
  – Scanned for broken access control, injection issues, misconfigurations
  – Verified XSS protection, CSRF protection, security headers

• Wireshark Packet Analysis
  – Confirmed no PII transmitted in clear text
  – Verified HTTPS/TLS 1.3 encryption for all traffic

C. Authentication & Authorization
• JWT Token Authentication (HS256/HMAC-SHA256)
  – 30-minute token expiration
  – Secure token generation and validation
  – No ECDSA vulnerabilities (application uses HMAC, not ECDSA)

• Password Security
  – bcrypt hashing (minimum 10 rounds)
  – Passwords never stored in plain text
  – Secure password reset flow

• Session Management
  – Secure session handling
  – Automatic logout after inactivity
  – Token refresh mechanisms

D. Database Security (Supabase RLS)
• Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies
  – Users can access only their own data
  – Enforced at database level (cannot be bypassed)
  – Least-privilege access principle

• PII Tokenization
  – AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
  – Separate tokenization table
  – Secure key management

E. Data Protection
• HTTPS/TLS 1.3 Encryption
  – All data encrypted in transit
  – Modern cipher suites
  – Perfect forward secrecy

• Input Validation & Injection Protection
  – Parameterized database queries (SQL injection protection)
  – XSS protection in React components
  – Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

• Logging & Error Handling
  – No sensitive data in logs
  – Error messages do not leak internal information
  – Security event monitoring

F. Compliance
• GDPR Article 32 (Security of Processing)
  – Appropriate technical and organizational measures
  – Regular security testing and monitoring
  – Documented security controls

• GDPR Article 15 (Right to Access) & Article 17 (Right to Deletion)
  – User data export functionality
  - Account deletion with cascade

• EU AI Act Transparency
  – AI decision logging
  – Explainability for AI-generated content
  – User control over AI features

G. Known Vulnerabilities (1 Remaining)
As of December 19, 2025:
• ecdsa 0.19.1 timing attack (CVE-2024-23342)
  – Severity: High (CVSS 7.4) - but LOW RISK for this application
  – Impact: None - Application uses HS256 (HMAC-SHA256), NOT ECDSA
  – Status: Accepted risk, monitored monthly for patches
  – No fix available (ecdsa project considers side-channel attacks out of scope)

2. What These Tests Mean for You
These checks help identify issues early and improve the safety of your testing experience.

Important Limitations:
• Security testing is ongoing and evolving
• No system can guarantee perfect security
• Beta software may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities
• We continue to improve security measures as the beta progresses

While we follow modern security practices, this is early-stage software and security controls will continue to mature.

3. What Bassline Pilates Does NOT Do
• We do not sell or rent your data.  
• We do not use third‑party advertising or behavioural tracking.  
• We do not collect sensitive health data such as injuries or medical history.  

4. What You Should Know as a Tester
Because this is a beta:
• Bugs may appear.  
• Features may behave inconsistently.  
• Data may be reset during updates.  
• Security controls will continue to evolve.

Please report anything unusual to: laura.redm@gmail.com or via the feedback link on the application settings page.

5. How Your Data Is Stored
All core data is stored in the EU:
• Supabase (Ireland – eu-west-1)  
• Render Backend (Germany – eu-central-1)  
• Resend Email Infrastructure (EU region, with limited metadata potentially processed in US under standard contractual clauses)

Netlify serves the static frontend globally but does not store user data.

6. Your Responsibilities
• Use a strong, unique password.  
• Do not share screenshots or internal features publicly.  
• Report issues or concerns quickly.  

7. Contact
If you have questions, contact: laura.redm@gmail.com or via the feedback link on the application settings page.
