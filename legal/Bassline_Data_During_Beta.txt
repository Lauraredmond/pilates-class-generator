Your Data During Beta Testing – Bassline Pilates

Thank you for taking part in the Bassline Pilates beta. This document explains, in clear and simple terms, how your data is used, stored, and protected while the app is still in early testing.

1. What Data We Collect
During beta testing we collect only the data needed to provide your personalised Pilates experience and improve the stability of the app:
• Email address (for login and account recovery)  
• Password (securely hashed; never visible to us)  
• Age Range
• Gender Identity
• Country
• Your class preferences (duration, ability level, intensity)
• Your practice history (movements performed, timestamps, muscle-group usage)
• Music genre selections for class background music (Baroque, Classical, Romantic, etc.)
• Basic device information (browser type, operating system, timestamp)
• Non-identifying analytics (page views, crashes, errors)
• Browser storage (authentication tokens, medical disclaimer acceptance, app version)

We do not collect biometric data, medical information, GPS location, microphone or camera data.

Note: We do not use traditional cookies, third-party trackers, or advertising cookies. We only use browser localStorage to keep you logged in, which is automatically cleared when you log out.

2. Why We Collect This Data
We use your information to:
• Generate tailored Pilates classes  
• Track progression and maintain balanced muscle engagement  
• Improve accuracy and stability of the class‑generation engine  
• Diagnose bugs and performance issues  
• Keep your account secure through activity logs

We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or resale.

3. Where Your Data Is Stored
Your data stays within the EU for all core functions:
• Supabase – Primary database in Ireland (eu-west-1)  
• Render – Backend services in Frankfurt, Germany (eu-central-1)  
• Netlify – Serves only the frontend; does not store personal data  
• Resend – Sends emails through EU infrastructure; limited metadata may be processed in the US under GDPR Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)

4. Security Measures in Place
To protect your data, we maintain comprehensive security controls (last updated: December 19, 2025):

Infrastructure Security:
• Python 3.11.14 runtime with latest security patches
• 95% vulnerability reduction achieved (40 → 1 known vulnerabilities)
• Automated security scanning (pip-audit, npm audit)
• All critical dependencies updated:
  - Cryptography 46.0.3 (fixes 4 CVEs including RSA key exchange vulnerability)
  - Web framework 3.12.14 (fixes 6 CVEs including XSS and request smuggling)
  - Authentication library 3.5.0 (fixes 2 CVEs)
  - Network library 2.6.0 (fixes 4 CVEs including resource exhaustion)

Data Protection:
• PII tokenization using AES-256 encryption
• Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) policies enforced
• JWT authentication tokens with HS256 (HMAC-SHA256)
• HTTPS/TLS encryption for all data in transit
• Password hashing using bcrypt (never stored in plain text)

Code Security Testing:
• Claude Code secure-coding review
• GitGuardian secret-leak scanning
• OWASP ZAP automated vulnerability scanning
• Wireshark packet analysis confirming no PII transmitted in clear text
• Regular dependency audits and updates

Compliance:
• GDPR Article 15 (right to access), Article 17 (right to deletion), Article 32 (security measures)
• EU AI Act transparency requirements for AI-generated content
• Monthly security reviews and monitoring

Note: While extensive security measures are in place, one remaining low-risk vulnerability (ecdsa timing attack) has been documented. This does not affect the application as we use HMAC-SHA256, not ECDSA, for authentication.

5. How Long We Keep Your Data
Your data is retained for the duration of the beta.  

If you stop using the beta, we may remove inactive accounts after 12 months.

6. Your Rights
You may:
• Request a copy of your data  
• Ask for corrections  
• Request deletion  
• Withdraw from the beta at any time  

7. Your Responsibilities
• Use a strong password  
• Do not share screenshots or internal features publicly  
• Inform us of bugs or security concerns
