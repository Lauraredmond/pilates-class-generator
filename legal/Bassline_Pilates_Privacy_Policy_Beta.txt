Bassline Pilates Privacy Policy (Beta)

Last Updated: December 2025
Status: Early Beta Version — Subject to Change

1. Introduction
Welcome to Bassline Pilates (“we”, “our”, “us”). We provide a personalised Pilates planning and training experience that adapts to your practise history, muscle-group usage, and preferences. Because this is a beta release, some features, controls, and protections are still evolving — but we take your privacy seriously and want you to understand exactly how your data is used and protected.

This Privacy Policy explains:
• What data we collect
• Why we collect it
• How we store and protect it
• Who has access
• Your rights
• How to contact us

If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the beta version of Bassline Pilates.

2. What Data We Collect
We only collect the minimum data necessary to operate the beta, generate your personalised classes, and improve system performance.

A. Account Information
• Email address
• Encrypted password
• Account creation timestamps
• Age Range
• Gender Identity
• Country

B. Profile & Training Preferences
• Optional preference selections
• Pilates experience level

C. Practice & Movement Data
We store:
• Movements used in each class
• Muscle groups activated per session
• Practise history
• Class generation parameters
• Music genre selections for class background music (Baroque, Classical, Romantic, etc.)

Play Session Data
When you play a Pilates class, we automatically track your interaction with the class to help us understand user engagement and improve the platform. We collect:

• Session Information:
  - When you started and ended the class
  - Total time spent playing the class
  - Whether you completed the entire class
  - Which section you reached (preparation, warmup, movements, etc.)
  - Furthest section you reached during the session

• Interaction Metrics:
  - Number of times you paused
  - Number of times you skipped forward
  - Number of times you rewound/went back
  - Playback source (library, generated, shared, preview)

• Device Information:
  - Browser type and version
  - Operating system
  - Screen width and height
  - Whether you're using a mobile device

Purpose: This data helps us:
- Distinguish between users who create classes vs. those who actually perform them
- Understand which classes are most engaging and completed
- Identify where users struggle or lose interest
- Improve the user experience based on interaction patterns
- Provide analytics for platform improvement

Qualified Plays: Sessions under 120 seconds (2 minutes) are not counted as "qualified plays" to filter out brief previews and accidental clicks. Only sessions where you engage for at least 2 minutes are included in our engagement metrics.

Legal Basis: Legitimate Interest (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) - We have a legitimate interest in understanding how our platform is used to improve service quality. This does not override your fundamental rights and freedoms.

Your Control: You can view all your play sessions via Settings > Developer Tools (if you're an admin) or by contacting us to request your data under GDPR Article 15 (Right to Access). All play sessions are protected by Row-Level Security, ensuring you can only access your own data.

Data Storage: EU (Ireland) via Supabase
Data Retention: Duration of beta testing period, then reviewed

D. Device & Technical Information
Automatically collected:
• Browser type/version
• Operating system
• Device type
• IP address
• Basic usage analytics

E. Diagnostic & Security Data
Collected to ensure safe functioning:
• Error logs
• System performance metrics
• Security scan metadata

F. Browser Storage (localStorage)
To keep you logged in and ensure the app functions correctly, we store the following data in your browser's local storage:
• Authentication tokens (JWT) - Required to keep you logged in
• Medical disclaimer acceptance - Required to comply with safety regulations
• App version - Required to prevent data corruption during updates

This data is stored locally on your device only, is not shared with third parties, and is automatically deleted when you log out or delete your account.

Note: We do not use traditional cookies, third-party trackers, or advertising cookies.

We do not collect biometric data, medical records, financial data, location data, or camera/microphone data.

3. How We Use Your Data
Used for:
• Class generation
• Tracking muscle engagement
• Improving accuracy and stability
• Security and account integrity
• Monitor Class Engagement: We track when and how users play classes (session duration, completion rates, interaction patterns) to understand user engagement and improve the platform. Sessions under 120 seconds are not counted as "qualified plays."

We do not sell or share your data for advertising.

F. Beta Limitations
While comprehensive security measures are in place:
• Features may change during beta testing
• Bugs may appear and will be addressed promptly
• Security measures continue to evolve and improve
• No system can guarantee 100% security

5. Who Has Access to Your Data
A. Internal Access
Only the founder has access to error logs, anonymised analytics, and security alerts.

B. Third-Party Providers
Supabase, Netlify, and Render process data only as needed.

	•	Data Residency
Bassline Pilates is designed to keep user data within the European Union wherever commercially and technically possible.
• Supabase (Primary Database & Authentication):
All user account data, workout history, and analytics stored in Supabase are hosted in 	Ireland (eu-west-1).
• Render (Backend Services):
Backend API services are deployed in Frankfurt, Germany (eu-central-1). Data 	exchanged between Supabase and Render remains within the EU.
• Netlify (Frontend Hosting):
The application’s frontend is served globally via CDN, but no personal data is stored or 	processed by Netlify. User data flows directly from the user’s browser to Supabase in 	Ireland.
• Resend (Transactional Email):
Bassline Pilates uses Resend’s EU email infrastructure (eu-west-1, Ireland) for sending 		verification and password-reset emails.
Limited account-level metadata (e.g., delivery status logs) may be processed by Resend 		in the United States under Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).
Overall, all core user data (identity, workout usage, preferences, history, and logs) is stored and processed exclusively within the EU, with only minimal email-delivery metadata potentially processed outside the EU using GDPR-approved safeguards.
