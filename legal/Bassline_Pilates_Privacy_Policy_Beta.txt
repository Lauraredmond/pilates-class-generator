	•	Data Residency
Bassline Pilates is designed to keep user data within the European Union wherever commercially and technically possible.
• Supabase (Primary Database & Authentication):
All user account data, workout history, and analytics stored in Supabase are hosted in 	Ireland (eu-west-1).
• Render (Backend Services):
Backend API services are deployed in Frankfurt, Germany (eu-central-1). Data 	exchanged between Supabase and Render remains within the EU.
• Netlify (Frontend Hosting):
The application’s frontend is served globally via CDN, but no personal data is stored or 	processed by Netlify. User data flows directly from the user’s browser to Supabase in 	Ireland.
• Resend (Transactional Email):
Bassline Pilates uses Resend’s EU email infrastructure (eu-west-1, Ireland) for sending 		verification and password-reset emails.
Limited account-level metadata (e.g., delivery status logs) may be processed by Resend 		in the United States under Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).
Overall, all core user data (identity, workout usage, preferences, history, and logs) is stored and processed exclusively within the EU, with only minimal email-delivery metadata potentially processed outside the EU using GDPR-approved safeguards.

6. Data Retention
Retained for the beta duration unless deleted upon request.

7. Your Rights
• Access, delete, correct, export data
• Withdraw consent

8. Children’s Privacy
Not intended for individuals under 16.

9. Changes
We may update this policy. You will be notified of significant changes.
