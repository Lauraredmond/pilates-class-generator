# EDUCATIONAL NOTE - Jentic Integration
# ==============================================================================
#
# When Jentic publishes their libraries to PyPI, the integration will look like:
#
# from standard_agent import StandardAgent, ReWOOReasoner, OpenAILLM
# from arazzo_engine import ArazzoEngine, Workflow
#
# Until then, we'll create stubs that mirror their architecture so Bassline
# can understand the integration patterns.
#
# Jentic Architecture:
# - standard-agent: Agent base class, reasoners, LLM adapters, tool registry
# - arazzo-engine: Workflow execution engine, YAML parser, runtime expressions
#
# Our Implementation:
# - agents/bassline_agent.py: Extends StandardAgent (stub)
# - app/services/arazzo_stub.py: Arazzo Engine stub
# - app/services/llm_stub.py: LLM adapter stubs
#
# This gives Bassline the same code structure they'll have when Jentic's
# libraries are available, making the transition seamless.
