-- VERIFICATION QUERY
-- ============================================================================
-- Run this after executing the updates to verify fields are populated:
--
-- SELECT movement_number, name,
--        CASE
--          WHEN watch_out_points IS NULL THEN 'MISSING'
--          ELSE 'OK'
--        END as watch_out_status,

-- FROM movements
-- ORDER BY movement_number;

-- ============================================================================
-- SUMMARY
-- ============================================================================
-- All 34 movements have watch_out_points populated
-- 18 movements have visual_cues populated (16 do not have visual cues)
-- Watch out points may contain multiple items separated by newlines
-- Visual cues may contain multiple items separated by newlines
