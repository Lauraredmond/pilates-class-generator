Begin the movement with a posterior pelvic tilt, dropping back off the base of the pelvis tucking the tailbone under, breathing in as you go back and out as you return to the seated neutral position. To progress, increase the range of movement, dropping further back, aiming to lower one vertebra at a time as you move closer to the mat.

1ea6dbdd-8f49-4106-97c4-1b503085ab28	Full Body Recovery	gentle	Settle onto your mat and take a long inhale. As you exhale, reach your arms overhead and stretch your legs long, feeling the whole body lengthen from fingertips to toes. Stay here for a few moments.\n\n\n\nWhen you’re ready, bring your arms down and let your knees drop over to one side. Keep the shoulders relaxed and let the spine gently unwind. Come back through centre and drop the knees to the other side, letting the breath soften any tightness.\n\n\n\nFrom here, roll onto your hands and knees and sink your hips back into Child's Pose. Let the arms reach forward or soften by your sides. Feel the back open and widen with each breath, releasing the hips and lower spine.\n\n\n\nWhen you're ready, come back onto your back. Extend one leg toward the ceiling for a gentle hamstring stretch, holding behind the thigh or calf—no pulling. Breathe deeply, then switch to the other side. Bring the knee in toward the chest for a glute stretch, \ncrossing the ankle over the opposite thigh if that feels good. Let the hips slowly release.\n\n\n\nNow hug both knees into your chest. Give yourself a small rock side to side, massaging through the lower back and easing out any remaining tension.\n\n\n\nRoll onto your side, release lower leg long along the mat and hold the opposite foot or ankle for a quad stretch, drawing the heel gently toward you. Keep the hips level and the breath easy. Switch sides when you're ready.\n\n\n\nCome to a comfortable seated or kneeling position. Interlace the fingers behind you for a gentle chest stretch, opening the front of the body and lifting the heart. Keep the ribs soft as you breathe. Then sweep one arm across the body for a shoulder stretch, drawing it in gently with the opposite hand. Switch sides, keeping the neck relaxed and the breath smooth.\n\n\n\nFinish with a slow inhale through the nose…and a long exhale through the mouth.

1a46a2dc-dc5c-43c0-84d3-55a28cf5150e	Pilates Principles Introduction	principles	Find a comfortable standing space wherever you're exercising today. Stand comfortably with your feet parallel or slightly turned out, hip-distance apart. Ensure your knees are soft and not locked. \nBalance your weight evenly through both feet. \nPlace your forearms on your waist with your elbows bent at about ninety degrees, arms pointing straight forward.\nRotate your pelvis forward and notice the forearms tip slightly downward.\nNow roll the pelvis backward, gently tucking the tailbone under, and notice the forearms tip slightly upward.\nGently rock between these two motions and find the midpoint where your fingertips come back to level with the floor. That position — where your fingertips point straight ahead — is your neutral pelvis. \n\n\n\nElongate the spine, imagining a string lifting the crown of the head upward. Roll the shoulders gently, allowing the shoulder blades to gently cinch and then widen across the back. \nKeep your chin level and your gaze forward. This is your neutral spine setup. \n\n\n\nNext, we'll set up your breathing. Gently draw your lower abdomen inward, as though zipping up a light corset or belt. \nPlace your hands on the base of your ribs, fingers touching. As you breathe in, allow the ribcage to widen to the sides and feel the breath move into the sides and back of the ribs. Keep the shoulders relaxed. \nAs you breathe out, feel the ribs draw softly back toward the centre and your fingertips come together again. This is lateral thoracic breathing.	{Centering,Concentration,Control,Precision,Breath,Flow}	120	2025-11-29 22:56:24.758149+00	2025-12-08 23:21:13.709236+00	[]	f	https://lixvcebtwusmaipodcpc.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/movement-voiceovers/1-Preparation-Phase.mp3	110	t	https://d1chkg8zq1g5j8.cloudfront.net/Generic_Placeholder.mp4

9074f146-a183-413d-b098-9b67c9dd2b2c	Comprehensive Full Body Warm-up	full_body	Let's begin our short warm-up before we move into the movement phase of the class.\n\nCome down onto your mat and lie comfortably on your back, knees bent and feet flat. Take a moment to settle.\n\nWe'll start with gentle pelvic tilts.\n\nOn your exhale, imprint the spine, closing the space between your lower back and the mat.\n\nInhale to release back to neutral, reopening that space.\n\nRepeat, noticing the change in range and control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we'll move into hip rolls.\n\nBring the heels toward the glutes.\n\nFrom neutral, exhale to peel the spine off the mat into a bridge, lifting only as high as feels comfortable.\n\nPause briefly at the top.\n\nExhale to roll the spine back down, one vertebra at a time.\n\nKeep the movement smooth and controlled. Repeat a few times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's open the upper back with ribcage arcs.\n\nStretch the legs long on the mat.\n\nInhale to take the arms overhead, stopping before the ribs flare.\n\nExhale to float the arms back above the chest, hands reaching upward.\n\nAllow the upper spine to open gently with each breath.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we'll add spinal rotation.\n\nBend the knees and open the arms out to the sides.\n\nInhale as both knees drift to one side.\n\nExhale to return through centre, then move to the other side.\n\nLet the movement stay easy and fluid. Repeat twice each way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll continue into thoracic rotation.\n\nRoll onto your side with knees bent and arms stacked in front.\n\nExhale to open the top arm, allowing the chest to rotate toward the ceiling.\n\nInhale to return to centre.\n\nRepeat once more, then switch sides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome up to a seated or kneeling position for shoulder mobilisation.\n\nGently roll the shoulders, letting the shoulder blades glide together and apart.\n\nThen create small, smooth arm circles forward and back, keeping the movement light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we'll mobilise the hips.\n\nLie back on your mat with knees bent and together.\n\nBring one leg into level 1 of the hundred, place the hand on the knee and gently make circles with the knee. Use your hand as a guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow change direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow switch legs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep the pelvis stable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is all about control, precision, and gentle activation.\n\nCome to a comfortable seated or standing position.\n\nFeel the breath steady, the spine long, and the body warm and ready to move.\n	[{"name": "Neck Rolls", "reps": 5, "direction": "each way", "description": "Gentle head circles to mobilize cervical spine"}, {"name": "Shoulder Circles", "reps": 8, "direction": "forward and back", "description": "Large arm circles"}, {"name": "Cat-Cow", "reps": 10, "description": "Spinal flexion and extension"}, {"name": "Hip Circles", "reps": 8, "direction": "each leg", "description": "Lying on back, leg circles in air"}, {"name": "Glute Bridge", "reps": 10, "description": "Activate glutes and hamstrings"}, {"name": "Chest Expansion", "reps": 8, "description": "Open chest, hands clasped behind back"}]	400	{"Acute injury in any area"}	{"easier": "Skip any painful movements", "harder": "Add breath holds, increase reps"}	Beginner	2025-12-03 20:37:51.828253+00	2025-12-09 00:29:34.97232+00	{"Hip Flexor Strengthening","Glute Strength","Spinal Mobility","Scapular Stability","Hamstring Strength","Chest Stretch"}	t	https://lixvcebtwusmaipodcpc.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/movement-voiceovers/2.warmup_routine_v2.mp3	390	t	https://d1chkg8zq1g5j8.cloudfront.net/Generic_Placeholder.mp4
